Password Manager:

Aim:
- Learn about password managers and choices invovled in creating them
	- what is common practice?
	- what should not be done
- Learn a new language(maybe rust) that has sufficient crypto libraries to implement this project

TODO:
- Create an example password manager that implements some common practices of password managers
	- vault can be stored locally or on SQL or noSQL DB(look into this further, likely SQL preferred)
	- vault is encrypted by master password
	- vault entries are encrypted by storage key(probably wrong term)
	- storage key is encrypted by master password, and is part of vault
